% Base case: The sum of integers from 1 to 1 is 1.
sum_integers(1, 1).

% Recursive case: The sum of integers from 1 to n is N + Sum1ToN,
% where Sum1ToN is the sum of integers from 1 to n-1.
sum_integers(N, Sum) :-
    N > 1,
    N1 is N - 1,
    sum_integers(N1, Sum1ToN),
    Sum is N + Sum1ToN.
